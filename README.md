# Lightweight.DDD – Practical Patterns and Ideas from Real Projects

> ⚠️ This is not a framework. It’s not a standard. It’s a perspective. A set of ideas shared with curiosity and humility.

## ✨ What This Is

This repository is a small collection of practical design patterns and ideas I’ve found useful while working on real-world Domain-Driven Design (DDD) projects.

I don’t claim to have all the answers. This is just my interpretation — shaped by experience, shaped by constraints — and it may not be universally correct.

These aren’t polished blueprints or definitive solutions. They’re lightweight building blocks — tools that helped me structure, simplify, and evolve code in ways that felt maintainable and expressive.

I don’t expect these patterns to be reused as-is. Instead, I hope they give you a starting point — something to explore, question, or adapt into your own design, based on your domain and needs.

### I believe:
- Patterns work best when **adapted**, not adopted blindly  
- DDD should be **tailored** to the domain, not templated  
- Examples are most valuable when they’re **focused** and **simplified**, not bloated with boilerplate

## 🔍 Included Patterns (So Far)

- ✅ `DomainEntity<TKey>` and `VersionedDomainEntity<TKey>`
- ✅ `IDomainEvent`, `IDomainEntity`, and event dispatching contracts
- ✅ `Result<T>`, `IError` for structured result modeling and control flow
- ✅ Virtual Entity Pattern for safe partial hydration of aggregates
- ✅ Guard extensions for expressive null/default checks

> More will be added and refined over time.

## ❤️ Why I’m Sharing This

Because I’ve been there:
- Trying to follow DDD while struggling to balance **purity with practicality**
- Seeing frameworks that **overcomplicate simple problems**
- Finding little tricks that solved **big headaches**

If anything here helps you think more clearly, ship more confidently, or discuss DDD more deeply — then it was worth publishing.

Please feel free to fork, adapt, evolve, simplify, or challenge what you find here.

Thanks for reading 🙇‍♂️
