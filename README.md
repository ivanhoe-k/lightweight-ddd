# Lightweight.DDD ‚Äì Practical Patterns and Ideas from Real Projects

> üåü If you find this helpful, a star would mean a lot!  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is not a framework. It‚Äôs not a standard. It‚Äôs a perspective. A set of ideas shared with curiosity and humility.

## ‚ú® What This Is

This repository is a small collection of practical design patterns and ideas I‚Äôve found useful while working on real-world Domain-Driven Design (DDD) projects.

I don‚Äôt claim to have all the answers. This is just my interpretation ‚Äî shaped by experience, shaped by constraints ‚Äî and it may not be universally correct.

These aren‚Äôt polished blueprints or definitive solutions. They‚Äôre lightweight building blocks ‚Äî tools that helped me structure, simplify, and evolve code in ways that felt maintainable and expressive.

I don‚Äôt expect these patterns to be reused as-is. Instead, I hope they give you a starting point ‚Äî something to explore, question, or adapt into your own design, based on your domain and needs.

### I believe:
- Patterns work best when **adapted**, not adopted blindly  
- DDD should be **tailored** to the domain, not templated  
- Examples are most valuable when they‚Äôre **focused** and **simplified**, not bloated with boilerplate

## üîç Included Patterns (So Far)

- ‚úÖ `DomainEntity<TKey>` and `VersionedDomainEntity<TKey>`
- ‚úÖ `IDomainEvent`, `IDomainEntity`, and domain event dispatching contracts
- ‚úÖ `Result<TError, TValue>` and `Result<TError>` for explicit control flow and structured errors
- ‚úÖ Virtual Entity Pattern ‚Äî safe partial hydration and fine-grained change tracking  
  Includes:
  - `VirtualPropertyBase<TEntity, TProperty, TSelf>`
  - Sealed variants: `VirtualProperty<TEntity, TProperty>`, `NullableVirtualProperty<TEntity, TProperty>`
  - Internal-only `IResolvable` interface for safe builder-only hydration
  - Explicit domain mutation via `Update(...)`
  - Flags: `HasResolved`, `HasChanged` for lifecycle control
  - Typed argument containers and builders (`VirtualArgs`, `VirtualArgsBuilderBase`)
- ‚úÖ Guard extensions for expressive null/default checks
- ‚úÖ Domain-level workflows for orchestrating domain logic in a consistent and technology-agnostic way
- ‚úÖ Read/Write repository split to encourage logical CQRS boundaries in the domain layer

## üìÖ Example Use Case: Profile + Virtual Entity Pattern

The `LightweightDdd.Examples` project includes a working `Profile` aggregate that demonstrates:

- Immutable Value Objects (`Address`, `PersonalInfo`, `Media`)
- Versioned aggregate with domain events (`ProfileOnboarded`, `AvatarUpdated`, etc.)
- Business rules expressed via methods returning `Result<DomainError>`
- Support for partial hydration through `VirtualProfile`
- Guarded property access with `VirtualProperty<T>`, throwing on unresolved fields
- Fluent args builder (`VirtualProfileArgsBuilder`) for type-safe resolution
- Support for detecting mutations without full entity tracking (`HasChanged`)

This example shows how to avoid over-fetching, prevent silent logic errors, and still maintain rich domain behavior ‚Äî even when dealing with partial state.

### üîÑ Hypothetical Usage

```csharp
// Simulate a projection for a business case: verifying a profile
var projection = new
{
    Id = Guid.NewGuid(),
    Version = 3,
    Verification = VerificationStatus.Pending
};

// Build only what we need for this operation
var args = VirtualProfileArgs
    .GetBuilder()
    .WithVerification(projection.Verification)
    .Build();

// Create a virtual version of the entity
var result = Profile.CreateVirtual(projection.Id, projection.Version, args);

if (result.Failed)
{
    // Handle invalid ID/version/etc.
    return;
}

var virtualProfile = result.Value;

// Domain logic succeeds
var verifyResult = virtualProfile.Verify();

// But accessing something unresolved throws:
var name = virtualProfile.PersonalInfo.FullName;
// ‚Üë Throws VirtualPropertyAccessException since PersonalInfo wasn't resolved
```

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Why I‚Äôm Sharing This

Because I‚Äôve been there:
- Trying to follow DDD while struggling to balance **purity with practicality**
- Seeing frameworks that **overcomplicate simple problems**
- Finding little tricks that solved **big headaches**

If anything here helps you think more clearly, ship more confidently, or discuss DDD more deeply ‚Äî then it was worth publishing.

Please feel free to fork, adapt, evolve, simplify, or challenge what you find here.

### ‚öôÔ∏è What Might Be Coming Next (Experimental Ideas)

While Lightweight.Ddd is intentionally minimal, there are a couple of directions I‚Äôm exploring based on real-world  challenges I‚Äôve encountered while working on Domain-Driven projects, both in personal explorations and commercial environments.

#### üö¶ 1. Railway-Oriented Result Extensions

One potential area of improvement is a lightweight, fluent API for `Result<T>` and `Result<TError, TValue>`, focused on expressive success/failure pipelines.

Planned additions include:

| Method           | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Then`           | Chain monadic operations (`Result<T> -> Result<U>`)                     |
| `Map`            | Transform the success value (`T -> U`), preserving structure            |
| `Catch`          | Handle or react to failure without changing the result                  |
| `CatchIf`        | Handle failures conditionally based on error predicate                 |
| `Tap`            | Side-effect on success (e.g., logging)                                  |
| `TapFailure`     | Side-effect on failure                                                  |
| `Ensure`         | Enforce domain invariants ‚Äî convert success into failure                |
| `Match`          | Terminal: exhaustively handle both branches and return raw value       |

Design goals:
- Async support via overloads (no `Async` postfix)
- Terse and idiomatic naming (`Then`, `Tap`, etc.)
- Designed for real-world domain logic, not academic monad purity

### üå± 2. Domain Effects (Async Side Effects with Boundaries)

I‚Äôve been experimenting with a clean domain-level model for **Domain Effects**:
- Effects are not raised directly by aggregates
- Instead, they are often produced by **domain event handlers**, allowing flexible many-to-many relationships between events and effects
- They represent **meaningful async operations** that happen as a result of domain behavior (e.g., sending notifications, scheduling delayed domain actions, background image processing, or publishing integration events)

In some projects, I‚Äôve implemented this with:
- A **transactional outbox** to persist effects alongside the aggregate
- A **workflow** that:
  1. Retrieves batches of effects (prioritized)
  2. Resolves effect handlers
  3. Applies them (in parallel if needed)
  4. Updates their statuses (e.g. success/failure)

What‚Äôs important is that this design lives entirely in the **domain layer**, relying only on clean **ports/abstractions**.  
While it includes orchestration logic (e.g., batching, retries, resolution), these operations are delegated to injected services ‚Äî keeping the core workflow free from infrastructure concerns and easily adaptable across different persistence or messaging implementations.

‚úÖ This approach has proven to be **reliable in both monolithic and distributed (microservices) architectures**.  
In monoliths, domain effect handlers may perform the operations directly.  
In service-based architectures, they can trigger **integration events** or enqueue work ‚Äî without compromising consistency.

> üìù These ideas are already implemented in some of my domain-driven projects where effects are persisted transactionally, prioritized based on domain-defined importance, and handled via clean abstractions.  
> I don‚Äôt yet know if I‚Äôll have the time or energy to extract and adapt these components for this toolkit ‚Äî but if I do, they could serve as a solid foundation for modeling domain effects and enabling reliable async workflows across bounded contexts.

If extracted, this might take the form of:
- A clean **domain effect abstraction**
- A **base class** relying only on ports
- Sample orchestration patterns

## üôè A Small Ask

This project isn't meant to be dropped in as-is or treated as a framework.

It's a collection of ideas ‚Äî building blocks you're free to **copy, adapt, and shape** to fit your domain.  
If anything here helped you think more clearly or saved you a few hours of design frustration...

‚≠ê **Please consider starring the repo** to show your support.  
That‚Äôs the best way to let me know this work has been useful ‚Äî and it genuinely helps motivate me to keep sharing more.

Thanks again for reading, exploring, and thinking through these ideas.
