# Lightweight.DDD ‚Äì Practical Patterns and Ideas from Real Projects

> üåü If you find this helpful, a star would mean a lot!  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is not a framework. It‚Äôs not a standard. It‚Äôs a perspective. A set of ideas shared with curiosity and humility.

## ‚ú® What This Is

This repository is a small collection of practical design patterns and ideas I‚Äôve found useful while working on real-world Domain-Driven Design (DDD) projects.

I don‚Äôt claim to have all the answers. This is just my interpretation ‚Äî shaped by experience, shaped by constraints ‚Äî and it may not be universally correct.

These aren‚Äôt polished blueprints or definitive solutions. They‚Äôre lightweight building blocks ‚Äî tools that helped me structure, simplify, and evolve code in ways that felt maintainable and expressive.

I don‚Äôt expect these patterns to be reused as-is. Instead, I hope they give you a starting point ‚Äî something to explore, question, or adapt into your own design, based on your domain and needs.

### I believe:
- Patterns work best when **adapted**, not adopted blindly  
- DDD should be **tailored** to the domain, not templated  
- Examples are most valuable when they‚Äôre **focused** and **simplified**, not bloated with boilerplate

## üîç Included Patterns (So Far)

- ‚úÖ `DomainEntity<TKey>` and `VersionedDomainEntity<TKey>`
- ‚úÖ `IDomainEvent`, `IDomainEntity`, and event dispatching contracts
- ‚úÖ `Result<T>`, `IError` for structured result modeling and control flow
- ‚úÖ Virtual Entity Pattern for safe partial hydration of aggregates  
  (includes `VirtualProfile`, `VirtualProperty<T>`, fluent builder + args model)
- ‚úÖ Guard extensions for expressive null/default checks

> More will be added and refined over time.

## üß™ Example: Virtual Entity with Profile

The `LightweightDdd.Examples` project includes a working `Profile` aggregate that demonstrates:

- Immutable Value Objects (`Address`, `PersonalInfo`, `Media`)
- Versioned aggregate with domain events (`ProfileOnboarded`, `AvatarUpdated`, etc.)
- Business rules expressed via methods returning `Result<IDomainError>`
- Support for partial hydration through `VirtualProfile`
- Guarded property access with `VirtualProperty<T>`, throwing on unresolved fields
- Fluent args builder (`VirtualProfileArgsBuilder`) for type-safe resolution

This example shows how to avoid over-fetching, prevent silent logic errors, and still maintain rich domain behavior ‚Äî even when dealing with partial state.

üîß This is still a work in progress. The example is not yet complete, and more patterns and scenarios will be added as time allows.

### üîÑ Hypothetical Usage

Even without a repository yet, here's what a potential usage of `VirtualProfile` might look like in a domain-specific scenario:

```csharp
// Simulate a projection for a business case: verifying a profile
var projection = new
{
    Id = Guid.NewGuid(),
    Version = 3,
    Verification = VerificationStatus.Pending
};

// Build only what we need for this operation
var args = VirtualProfileArgs
    .GetBuilder()
    .WithVerification(projection.Verification)
    .Build();

// Create a virtual version of the entity
var result = Profile.CreateVirtual(projection.Id, projection.Version, args);

if (result.Failed)
{
    // Handle invalid ID/version/etc.
    return;
}

var virtualProfile = result.Value;

// Domain logic succeeds
var verifyResult = virtualProfile.Verify();

// But accessing something unresolved throws:
var name = virtualProfile.PersonalInfo.FullName; 
// ‚Üë Throws VirtualPropertyAccessException since PersonalInfo wasn't resolved 
```

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Why I‚Äôm Sharing This

Because I‚Äôve been there:
- Trying to follow DDD while struggling to balance **purity with practicality**
- Seeing frameworks that **overcomplicate simple problems**
- Finding little tricks that solved **big headaches**

If anything here helps you think more clearly, ship more confidently, or discuss DDD more deeply ‚Äî then it was worth publishing.

Please feel free to fork, adapt, evolve, simplify, or challenge what you find here.

## üôè A Small Ask

This project isn't meant to be dropped in as-is or treated as a framework.

It's a collection of ideas ‚Äî building blocks you're free to **copy, adapt, and shape** to fit your domain.  
If anything here helped you think more clearly or saved you a few hours of design frustration...

‚≠ê **Please consider starring the repo** to show your support.  
That‚Äôs the best way to let me know this work has been useful ‚Äî and it genuinely helps motivate me to keep sharing more.

Thanks again for reading, exploring, and thinking through these ideas.
